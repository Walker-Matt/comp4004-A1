# comp4004-A1

(Test) = A new test or way of testing
(Code) = Any and all new project code
(Refactor) = Fixes to errors in either code or tests

NOTE: I'm learning this whole TDD process as I go, so some earlier commits may have violated the TDD rules in one way or another.
Also, JP just mentioned (On Sept 26th) that each test class should correspond to an equivalence class, so I will likely have to modify the organization of my tests soon to meet this requirement.
